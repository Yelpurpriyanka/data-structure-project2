## 1. Problem Explanation on LRU caching 

As I ought to design a data structure for a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with O(1) operations. It's the most suitable option to go with the dictionary in python which has constant-time access to values with a particular key. 

 Time complexity: O(1) 
The complexity of the LRU: O(capacity)
